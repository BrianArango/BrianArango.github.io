Today marks the end of my two weeks really trying to learn. So far it has not been the smoothest transition from going home from work and going out with friends to being unproductive to coming home from work to only focus on programming until I fall asleep. The first week I was in the process of car shopping for something different so that really took away from my focus and my learning. This second week I was having problems with the car I purchased so I have to focus about going back and worth and focusing on that. I do think that the third week will be so much better. Learning Ruby has been very interesting so far but I don't think I am understanding it as fast as I would like to so I will be reading books on Ruby while I get free time at work.
